## Inspiration

Organizations spend millions of dollars on their employees' physical and mental health. During the pandemic, remote work was at its peak, and health conditions have been decreasing ever since.

Working together has always contributed to the increased productivity of employees. To leverage this idea on health, we built `Physic`, a platform where teams manage their health together.

## What it does

`Physic` is a fitness app that helps people get along together to achieve their fitness goals. Sixty percent of people say fitness goals but end up giving up within a few days. Having a competitive spirit among teams helps keep good accountability and motivation so through junk to win and exercise together.

The users can add the meals taken throughout the day and calculate the number of calories consumed. While it also provides an option to track exercises, the user gets a score on the basis of how much active they are during the day. This data is used to rank the individual employees within the team and within the teams as well.

Time to build a healthy and productive team.

## How we built it

We built it on top of Flutter using Dart while having lots of coffee.

## Challenges we ran into

We majorly ran into the following three problems:
Some of us had our mid-term examinations going on with the hackathon.
Working remotely for the first time together in a fast-paced manner was challenging.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are proud of having fruitful discussions leading to the idea of this application.

## What we learned

We learned to debug bugs collaboratively while coding in pairs and effectively managing time to complete the project.

## What's next for Physic

We are thinking of using real-time data from smartwatches to automatically track the activity data from the user, rather than having them fill it manually.
